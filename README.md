Unreal representation of archeological site.

## The Goal

The goal of this project is to reconstruct "the idea" of an archaeological site located on the North-central coast of Peru that was occupied 6,000-7,000 years ago. 

## Background

The site is a 9x8 meter gratite stone structure (that is collapsed on itself), surrounded by a shell heap (midden) that is composed of a mixture of oysters and various other species ~that I can't remember right now~, and sits on top of a sea cliff that is 15 meters above sea level. 

When the site was occupied the ocean came right up to the edge of the sea cliff, but in present day it is 5 km to the west. 

There are 2 lines of sling-stone piles that are believed to be associated with this site. One line extends from the structure and the other is about 50 meters to its north. These piles are each composed of about 100 fist-sized rounded rocks (sometimes they are football shapped) and there are about 50 piles per line. 

In present day the site is completely surrounded by a desert environment with the Andean Mountains to its immediate east.
